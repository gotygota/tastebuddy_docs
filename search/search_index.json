Many factors have been shown to influence the judgement of the taster, whose evaluation of the same product can vary from one day to the next. It is particularly important for industry professionals to be able to obtain reasonably objective data in order to make business decisions, monitor trends or experiment with new processes.</p> <p>TasteBuddy is a web application for comparative sensory analysis of wines and spirits in both synchronous and asynchronous modes, guaranteeing the anonymity of both tasters and products. As an online tool, it is free from geographical and time constraints, while its anonymity allows users to express their opinions freely. It also provides visual tools for analysing the results of the tastings in order to highlight agreements and disagreements between the tasters, possible shortcomings in the sensory analysis, the evolution of the sensory profile of the products or their perception, and to evaluate the opinion of consumers with maximum objectivity.</p>"},{"location":"#about-this-documentation","title":"About this documentation","text":"<p>TasteBuddy users are divided into two categories, or <code>roles</code>.

Higher available scores for a given criterion result in a greater influence on the total score for that criterion.

Avoid leaving the possibility to assign a score exactly in the middle of the maximum and minimum, to force the assessors to chose a side. For example, avoid fixing scoring scales like <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code> (where 3 is the exact center). Instead, set the scale such as <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> or <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code>.
