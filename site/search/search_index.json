As an online tool, it is free from geographical and time constraints, while its anonymity allows users to express their opinions freely. It also provides visual tools for analysing the results of the tastings in order to highlight agreements and disagreements between the tasters, possible shortcomings in the sensory analysis, the evolution of the sensory profile of the products or their perception, and to evaluate the opinion of consumers with maximum objectivity.</p>"},{"location":"#about-this-documentation","title":"About this documentation","text":"<p>TasteBuddy users are divided into two categories, or <code>roles</code>.

Higher available scores for a given criterion result in a greater influence for that criterion on the overall evaluation. However, some of the analyses (in particular the Principal Component Analysis of the criteria) are performed on the value of the scores relative to their maximum (i.e. without taking into account the importance given to the criteria on the overall evaluation), and to make some of the charts (such as the radar charts) easier to read, the scores are sometimes normalised to a scale of 0-1.</p> <p>Avoid middle ground</p> <p>A common recommendation when defining a scoring scale for sensory evaluation is not to allow the choice of the exact centre. Avoid leaving the possibility of assigning a score exactly in the middle of the maximum and minimum to force the evaluators to choose a side. For example, avoid setting scoring scales such as <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code> (where 3 is the exact centre). Instead, set the scale like <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> or <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code>.

Prior to the evaluation itself, precautions can be taken directly to reduce as much as possible the level and scaling differences between tasters, in order to standardise their scores, and to ensure that the variability is due to the tasters themselves and not to the tasting conditions (see Regarding Calibration). Both are criteria that tasters can directly influence if they can see where they stand. After evaluation, the data collected can be pre-processed to mathematically reduce the differences before analysis.</p> <p>In a sense, level is a matter of calibration between assessors. A score of 80 should represent the same quality for the whole panel. It can be easily corrected by centering the individual scores on a common value (usually the panel average) before any analyses.</p> <p>Scaling is somewhat a matter of homogenisation between raters and individual confidence. This is easily seen in a box plot of the scores. For meaningful results, judges should aim for the largest possible scale to clearly differentiate products. It is important to note that an evaluator who does not show a clear differentiation between products (i.e. who would always give almost the same score) can probably be discarded from the overall analyses, unless the tendency is the same for all evaluators in the panel. This last scenario would prove that the products are very similar. The scaling differences between the raters can be reduced by normalising the scores individually after centering (usually with a min-max, mean or standard deviation function scaling).</p> <p>Variability is the difference in the rating of the same sample by a taster on different occasions. It is important to remember that the tasting conditions should be exactly the same in order to be absolutely unambiguous. In practice, the influence of products tasted immediately before or after will affect a taster's perception of a sample and some variability is to be expected. However, too much variability would probably require the taster to be discarded from further analysis, as it shows that the rating is more random than a true opinion.</p> <p>Of course, some disagreement is to be expected within a panel of judges: cultural differences between judges will affect their sensitivity to, and therefore their perception of, a number of product characteristics. However, there are intrinsic qualities and attributes that all should agree on. This is probably the most important result to analyse between the judges, and if personal information about the judges themselves (such as their age, gender, nationality, etc.) is available, some patterns can be drawn from the analysis of the results (preferences by age category, gender, nationality, etc.).</p>"},{"location":"results/#good-practices-in-sensory-analysis-calibration","title":"Good practices in sensory analysis: calibration","text":"<p>A crucial step in comparative sensory analysis, and one that is all too often underestimated, is calibration. It allows a panel of assessors to work with a common standard and to \"re-balance\" between samples.</p> <p>Calibration involves providing the panel with an additional sample, which is not analysed, but used as a standard for all other products. The scores for this sample are also fixed (either agreed by the panel or given directly) so that each of the samples to be evaluated can be compared to this base product: all the assessors then have a reference scale for scoring (reducing the potential level differences between the assessors) and the influence of the position of the sample within the tasting flight is reduced (thus providing a more meaningful analysis of taster variability). However, scale differences are not affected and require further careful analysis and/or data pre-processing (see section 1.3 Product or taster differences?).</p> <p>About anonymity</p> <p>Sensory analysis is meaningless unless the anonymity of both the tasters and the products is guaranteed. Ensuring that the products are unknown to the judges protects against any \"branding influence\" (brand history, price range, public opinion, etc. are many factors that have been shown to influence consumer ratings and evaluations). On the other hand, the anonymity of the tasters allows them to be free from \"peer pressure\" and gives them the confidence to express their own opinions.</p>"},{"location":"results/#types-of-dashboards","title":"Types of dashboards","text":"<p>Dashboards are graphical representations of sensory analysis results.

The rating scale is usually not used as an intensity scale, but as a \"just about right\" scale. The maximum score therefore corresponds to the exact expected expression of the criterion in question.</p> <p>For example, you might rate the sweetness of a particular product. In this case, a scale of 1 to 10 should not be understood as</p> <p>from <code>not sweet at all</code> to <code>excessively sweet</code></p> <p>but as</p> <p>from <code>too sweet or not sweet enough</code> to <code>perfectly sweet</code></p> <p>Remember to update the product information as soon as it becomes available if you were unable to do so at the time of tasting.</p> <p>You can visualise the result of the sensory evaluation by accessing the corresponding dashboard on https://tastebuddy.io/dashboards/, accessible from the left side bar or from the top right menu .</p>"},{"location":"user/tasting/#tasting-sessions","title":"Tasting sessions","text":""},{"location":"user/tasting/#entering-a-tasting-session","title":"Entering a tasting session","text":"<p>Each tasting session you are assigned to will appear on your home page in the <code>NEXT TASTING SESSIONS</code> section.
