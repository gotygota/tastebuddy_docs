Many factors have been shown to influence the judgement of the taster, whose evaluation of the same product can vary from one day to the next. It is particularly important for industry professionals to be able to obtain reasonably objective data in order to make business decisions, monitor trends or experiment with new processes.</p> <p>TasteBuddy is a web application for comparative sensory analysis of wines and spirits in both synchronous and asynchronous modes, guaranteeing the anonymity of both tasters and products. As an online tool, it is free from geographical and time constraints, while its anonymity allows users to express their opinions freely. It also provides visual tools for analysing the results of the tastings in order to highlight agreements and disagreements between the tasters, possible shortcomings in the sensory analysis, the evolution of the sensory profile of the products or their perception, and to evaluate the opinion of consumers with maximum objectivity.</p>"},{"location":"#about-this-documentation","title":"About this documentation","text":"<p>TasteBuddy users are divided into two categories, or <code>roles</code>.

There are three key components to this process:</p> <ul> <li>Tasters: they are the direct users of the application and the people who   provide their expertise on the samples being evaluated;</li> <li>Products: either wine or spirits, they are the samples on which the sensory   evaluation is performed;</li> <li>Tasting protocols: they define the set of criteria (and associated weights)   on which the evaluation will focus;</li> </ul> <p>Example protocols and products</p> <p>On account creation, a tasting protocol and example products are automatically added for illustrative purposes.

Conceptually, a sensory evaluation is based on three basic building blocks that can be combined and mixed depending on the scenario: a set of criteria or characteristics that the sensory analysis should focus on, assessors or tasters to provide the expertise, and of course the sample(s) to be evaluated.</p> <p>These fundamental building blocks can be created, edited or combined to achieve a defined goal.</p> Conceptual diagram of TasteBuddy functionning <p>Although products can be created on the fly (i.e. added directly at the time of evaluation), careful preparation and experimental design should be performed by the administrators before conducting any sensory evaluation.</p>"},{"location":"admin/#definitions","title":"Definitions","text":"<p>The following words will be used along this documentation. Getting familiar with the concepts will help to understand the next pages.</p> <code>Sensory evaluation</code> or <code>Tasting</code> <p>Sensory evaluation of a product based on a pre-defined set of criteria associated with a discrete point scale (e.g. sweet- ness from 1 to 6, complexity from 1 to 10, etc.). Comments from the taster can be associated with the criterion.</p> <code>Tasting criterion</code> <p>A characteristic of a product to be rated on a discrete scale. Usually grouped by category (e.g. nose, palate).</p> <code>Tasting sheet</code> or <code>Tasting grid</code> <p>A set of selected criteria used during a tasting. Any number of criteria can be used, depending on the application.</p> <code>Punctual tasting</code> <p>Sensory evaluation of a single product by a single assessor.</p> <code>Tasting session</code> <p>Comparative tasting of a number p of products in a predetermined order by a number a of evaluators. The ordered list of products is called a flight. The same tasting sheet is used for each product and by each taster; each taster must evaluate all the samples in one go, but they do not necessarily perform the evaluation synchronously. All products are evaluated at the same time, and it is possible to move back and forth between samples. A tracking page is associated, showing the progress of each associated user within the product flight.</p> <code>Dashboard</code> <p>Collection of graphics illustrating the results of past tastings</p> <code>Product</code> <p>Spirit or Wine on which a sensory evaluation is carried out.

Existing products are automatically suggested, but a completely    new sample can be automatically added to the database.</li> </ol> <p>Regular user rights</p> <p>A regular user can add their own product to the database, which will then appear in the organisation's sample list.
