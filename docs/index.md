# Getting started

Let's walk through the core concepts of the TasteBuddy application, how to manage
user accounts and profiles, tasting protocols, products, and how to conduct
sensory evaluations of wines and spirits and analyse the results of a sensory
evaluation.

## Overview

By its very nature, any sensory analysis, whether of spirits, wine, perfume
or food, is inherently subjective. Many factors have been shown to influence the
judgement of the taster, whose evaluation of the same product can vary from
one day to the next. It is particularly important for industry professionals to be
able to obtain reasonably objective data in order to make business decisions,
monitor trends or experiment with new processes.

TasteBuddy is a web application1 for comparative sensory analysis of wines and
spirits in both synchronous and asynchronous modes, guaranteeing the anonymity
of both tasters and products. As an online tool, it is free from geographical
and time constraints, while its anonymity allows users to express their opinions
freely. It also provides visual tools for analysing the results of the tastings
in order to highlight agreements and disagreements between the tasters, possible
shortcomings in the sensory analysis, the evolution of the sensory profile of
the products or their perception, and to evaluate the opinion of consumers with
maximum objectivity.

## About this documentation

TasteBuddy users are divided into two categories, or `roles`. What a user can do
or see is based on this role, further referred as either 'Admin' or 'Regular
User'. This documentation is therefore split between these two main roles:

- Administrators should follow the steps described in the [For admin section](admin/index.md)
- Regular user should follow the steps described in the [For user section](user/index.md)

If you are unsure of your permissions and role, [access your TasteBuddy profile page](https://tastebuddy.io/users/update/)
and look at the badge next to your name.

## Current development

Tastebuddy is still in active development, and may be a little rough around
the edges. Expect the unexpected!

Registrations are currently invite only. If you would like to get early access,
please [get in touch with us](https://tastebuddy.io/contact/).
