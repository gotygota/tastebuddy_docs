# Sensory evaluation in practice
!!! tools "Work in progress"
    This site is still under construction. Please come back later for further
    information and documentation.

We are now reaching the core of Tastebuddy: carrying out sensory evaluation of
wines and spirits.

## Categories of tastings
Tastebuddy makes a distinction between two different types of sensory
evaluation, which are to fit two distinct wide use cases:

1. :material-liquor: **Punctual or one-off tasting**: evaluation of a single product by a single
   assessor _{==on the go==}_
2. :material-glass-tulip::material-glass-tulip::material-glass-tulip: 
**Tasting session**: comparative sensory evaluation of two or more products _{==at
the same time==}_ sharing common characteristics by one or more assessors, in order to 
highlight the differences between these products and establish a ranking between
them

One of the main differences between the two situation is that the first one
allows for the _"unprepared"_ evaluation of samples (i.e. evaluating a sample
which is unknown and unplanned before the tasting itself), while the later
requires preparation work and a precise goal on what the comparative evaluation
of the samples should highlight.

You can read example use cases [on this page](../results/use-cases.md)
## Punctual tasting
To evaluate a sample _on the go_, from your homepage, click `Taste a spirit` or
`Taste a wine` a the bottom of the card corresponding to the tasting sheet you
want to use.

You will be brought to the tasting sheet. At the top of the form, you can fill
in product related information. Name and Category will be suggested if any
records are found in the database. Click on `Additional information` to extend
more product related fields. 

At this stage, only the product's name is required. The product's information
can always be updated later (see [Product information update](../admin/products.md#product-information-update).
It is strongly recommended to fill in all the information available for
potential further analysis. 

!!! warning "Filling in product information"
    Although product names and categories are suggested when filling in the
    information in the corresponding field, there is currently no link between the
    two, and it is therefore possible to create a new product record in the database
    by linking the wrong category with the product name.

    If two distinct product have been created and you wish to merge them as a
    single one, please contact your administrator to get in touch with us.
