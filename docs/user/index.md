!!! tools "Work in progress"
    This site is still under construction. Please come back later for further
    information and documentation.

The following sections describe how to make the most out of Tastebuddy. From
conducting one-off sensory evaluation individually to carrying out comparative
tasting sessions, we'll walk through the steps to get you autonomous on the
platform in no time.

## Prerequisites

The following pages assume the organization's administrators (see [Users
roles](../admin/user_administration.md#about-roles)) have already [invited
users](../admin/user_administration.md#adding-users), created
[tasting sheets](../admin/protocols.md#tasting-grid), [tasting sessions assigned
to users](../admin/protocols.md#tasting-session), and [added one or more
products](../admin/products.md).

Please refer to [the administrators documentation](../admin/index.md) if any of
the above mention steps have not been fulfilled.

They also assume that you already own an account on the platform. If you are new
to Tastebuddy and you wish to join our trial programme, please [contact
us](https://tastebuddy.io/contact/). If your organization is already using
Tastebuddy and you require an account, please ask your administrators to send
you an invitation directly from the platform.
