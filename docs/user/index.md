# Using Tastebuddy

The following sections will show you how to get the most out of Tastebuddy. From
conducting a one-off sensory evaluation to running comparative tasting sessions,
we'll walk you through the steps to get you up and running on the platform in no
time.

## Prerequisites

The following pages assume that the organisation's administrators (see [User
roles](../admin/user_administration.md#about-roles)) have already [invited
users](../admin/user_administration.md#adding-users), created
[tasting sheets](../admin/protocols.md#tasting-grid), [assigned tasting sessions
to users](../admin/protocols.md#tasting-session), and [added one or more
products](../admin/products.md).

Please refer to [the administrator documentation](../admin/index.md) if any of
the above mentionned steps have not been fulfilled.

They also assume that you already have an account on the platform. If you are new
to Tastebuddy and would like to join our trial programme, please [contact
us](https://tastebuddy.io/contact/). If your organisation is already using
Tastebuddy and you need an account, please ask your administrators to send
you an invitation directly from the platform.

## Getting started

Go to [https://tastebuddy.io/accounts/login/](https://tastebuddy.io/accounts/login/)
and use your registered email address and password to log in to your homepage.

The landing page provides quick access to your profile, as well as the tasting
protocols created within your organisation.[^1]

- To [update your login and personal information](profile.md), click on {++View my
  profile++};
- If you have been assigned tasting sessions, they will appear in the `NEXT 
  TASTING SESSIONS` card just below your profile banner. From the
  scheduled date, click on `Access` to [start the comparative sensory evaluation of a
  flight of samples](tasting.md#tasting-sessions) (note that it is not possible to
  conduct a comparative tasting without previously creating the protocol. See
  [Creating a Tasting Session](../admin/protocols.md#tasting-session) for more
information);
- All the existing tasting grids created within your organisation can be
  accessed directly from the corresponding card [for one-off or punctual
  tasting](tasting.md#punctual-tasting)

Once you have added products to the database (either from [the corresponding
product page](../admin/products.md) or directly from a [punctual
tasting](tasting.md#punctual-tasting), you can edit their information by clicking
on the corresponding product type in the left sidebar or in the top right menu
:material-view-grid:.

After you have submitted sensory evaluation data, you can view the
[corresponding dashboards](../results/index.md) from the Dashboard menu in the
left sidebar or in the top right menu :material-view-grid:. Note that
in the case of tasting sessions, you won't be able to view results until
all the assigned tasters have completed the session, or after the session has expired.

    All the protocols, your profile as well as the results dashboards can also
    be accessed directly from the left sidebar and the top right menu
